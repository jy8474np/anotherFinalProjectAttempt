Intro

My initial idea of a budget app ended-up being more of a personal ledger in which one can enter income, expense, and saving items. The app is made-up of several components.

The income, expense, and savings components have two inputs each: a drop-down menu and a field input. An error is generated if both inputs are not completed. Each Add (submit) button adds the information to the table.

Each ledger item added to the table is color coordinated to reflect its nature. The table has a toggle for editablity, a delete function, and a confirmation prompt.

I created a record database, which is functional.

I was able to create an app in Heroku (warm-beach-45850) and a database within that app via my terminal, but as of this writing, the Heroku app is not properly functioning.

SOURCES

The ongoing, multi-lab Student Sign-In app was obviously my largest influence and source. Additionally, I used other code examples, lab assignments, and PowerPoint slides from class as a resource.

Outside, online resources were also used as guides/tutorials for code with which I had difficulty or was inexperienced. I altered/tailored
these outside resources so that they are unique to my project and not simply copied and pasted in to my files. Links to the various resources are listed below.

I attempted to add a chart, which is what I believe led to my file interactions getting confused. I took out as much of that code as I could, and "commented out" and remaining code of which I was unsure. Regardless, those references are as follows:
